WORKING PAPERS

“The Impact of Course Section Assignments on Education Outcomes” (job market paper)

Abstract: In this paper, I intend to examine how early morning (7:30 AM) classes affect students’ education outcomes. More specifically, I investigate the impact of early morning classes on students' propensity to take STEM classes in the future and students' choice of a major with a unique course registration process at a large public university in Indiana, USA. Implementing instrumental variable approach, I find that assignments to early morning classes increase non-STEM participation by roughly 53%, and students are less likely to choose a major directly corresponding to the assigned early morning classes by about 67%. To better understand the mechanisms of the findings, I explore two potential mechanisms: (1) academic performance and (2) non-academic reasons. I find that non-academic reasons are the major driving force to the results in this paper. One of the potential non-academic reasons is attribution bias. The contribution to the existing research is twofold: first, the student data provides a more suitable comparison with other university students in the United States; and second, the institutional structure and student body allow me to minimize the peer effect from the treatment effect.

“Kindness and Wage Gap” 

Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the impact of kindness on wage returns from five specific occupation classes: unskilled, partly skilled, skilled, managerial, and professional occupations. By using the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), I find that kind women are rewarded, but kind men are punished in unskilled occupations. This may be due to gender norm bias and the working cultures that do not require significant interpersonal and communication skills. On the other hand, both kind men and women in managerial occupations are rewarded, but men in managerial occupations have higher returns than women do. This may be attributed to the fact that managerial occupations require higher degrees of interpersonal communication skills with co-workers. Also, kindness among managerial workers would reduce communication cost and therefore, boost productivity.

“The Effect of Teacher Gender on Students' Education Outcomes” 

Abstract: Understanding the cause of gender and racial gaps in specific education fields is an important question for researchers and policymakers. There is a large literature focused on the impact of teachers' gender and race on students' education and labor market outcomes, but lack of clear identification in estimation or lack of external validity are common issues. In this project, we intend to examine how teachers' gender and race affect students' education and labor market outcomes: test scores, types of courses to study, choice of a major, and starting salary. We expect heterogenous effects by gender and race of the students. A unique course registration process at Purdue University created a natural experiment in which students were as good as randomly assigned to course sections and enables us to draw causal inference of the proposed research question. Purdue University is a four-year public university where student body and institutional details are more comparable with other universities in the United States.
